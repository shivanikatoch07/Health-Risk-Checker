## Problem Statement

In today’s busy lifestyle, many individuals ignore early signs of health risks such as high blood pressure, elevated sugar levels, and unhealthy lifestyle habits.
There is a need for a simple, beginner-friendly tool that can quickly assess a person’s health risk level using basic inputs.

This project aims to create a console-based Python program that evaluates and classifies a user’s health risk using conditional statements.

## Objective

The main objectives of the project are:

To collect basic health parameters from the user through console input.

To apply conditional logic to determine the user’s health risk level.

To categorize users into Low, Moderate, or High health risk.

To provide a simple, easy-to-use text-based interaction.

## Scope of the Project

This project covers:

Input of age, blood pressure, sugar level, and lifestyle.

Conditional evaluation of health risk.

Displaying the final health risk assessment in the console.

Beginner-friendly logic using only simple Python structures.

It does not include advanced medical diagnosis or professional risk assessment.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Development Environment: Any Python IDE or terminal

Python Concepts Used:

Input/output functions

Variables

Conditional statements (if–elif–else)

Basic number handling

## Methodology
Step 1 – Input Collection

The program asks the user to enter:

Age

Blood Pressure (systolic)

Sugar Level (fasting mg/dL)

Lifestyle (Active / Moderate / Sedentary)

Step 2 – Processing

The collected data is evaluated using conditional logic.

Step 3 – Output

The program displays:

Entered values

Lifestyle category

Final health risk (Low / Moderate / High)

## Expected Output

The program should:

Accept valid numeric inputs

Reject invalid inputs politely

Display the correct risk category

Example output:

===== RESULT =====
Age: 45
Blood Pressure: 130
Sugar Level: 112
Lifestyle: Moderate
Final Assessment: Moderate Health Risk

## Project Limitations

Does not store data

Does not provide medical diagnosis

Works only with simple console input

User must enter correct values manually

## Conclusion

This console-based Python program successfully demonstrates how conditional statements can be used to assess basic health risks. It is simple, effective, and fulfills the requirements of an introductory Python project.
